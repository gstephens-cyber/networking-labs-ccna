# 🚀 Networking Labs Portfolio

This repository contains my complete collection of hands-on network engineering and network security labs, covering everything from foundational routing and switching to advanced enterprise-grade architectures.

These labs demonstrate real technical capability — routing protocols, segmentation, ACLs, perimeter design, and secure connectivity across Cisco-based environments.

This repo is actively expanding as I move through advanced networking and cybersecurity specializations.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This repo demonstrates hands-on, real-world networking and security engineering capability in:

Routing and switching fundamentals

VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing

NAT, PAT, and DHCP relaying

ACLs (standard and extended)

Layer-2 and Layer-3 network security concepts

Enterprise perimeter architecture

Multi-area OSPF routing design

Site-to-site VPN design (IPSec)

Redundancy and high availability using HSRP

IDS/SPAN monitoring and attack traffic inspection

🔥 Advanced Networking Track (In Progress)
These labs represent enterprise-level network architecture and security engineering.

01 – DMZ Firewall Design
Full enterprise DMZ with perimeter firewall, internal segmentation, static NAT, and ACL enforcement.

02 – Enterprise VLAN Segmentation
Finance, HR, Admin, Servers, and Guest VLANs with layer-3 routing and inter-VLAN ACL control.

03 – OSPF Multi-Area
Area 0 backbone with additional OSPF areas, summarization, and route filtering.

04 – Site-to-Site IPSec VPN
ISAKMP Phase 1/2, transform sets, crypto ACLs, and encrypted tunnel validation.

05 – L3 Core Switching
Routed core switch, SVIs, server segmentation, and ACL-based control.

06 – High Availability (HSRP)
Active/standby redundancy configuration with failover simulation and validation.

07 – IDS/SPAN Monitoring
SPAN port monitoring, Wireshark capture, attack analysis, and mitigation techniques.

🧪 Verification Commands
Each lab includes verification such as:

show ip route

show ip interface brief

show vlan

show spanning-tree

show access-lists

show ip ospf neighbor

show crypto isakmp sa

show standby

Wireshark packet capture analysis

Ping / Traceroute connectivity validation

🛠 Tools & Platforms
Cisco Packet Tracer (Primary for current labs on macOS)

GNS3 / EVE-NG (for advanced labs later on PC)

Wireshark

Linux and Windows endpoints (SPAN / IDS)

Firewall simulation (ASA/PF conceptual alignment)
