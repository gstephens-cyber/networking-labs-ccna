This repository documents each lab with topology diagrams, IP addressing, configs, and verification steps.

## Objectives

- Build and document small networks using **Cisco IOS** and **Packet Tracer**
- Practice core networking skills (VLANs, trunking, routing, DHCP, ACLs, etc.)
- Create a professional portfolio of **repeatable lab exercises**
