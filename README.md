# 🚀 Networking Labs Portfolio

This repository contains my complete collection of hands-on **network engineering and network security labs**, covering everything from foundational routing/switching to advanced enterprise-grade architectures.  
These labs demonstrate real technical capability — routing protocols, segmentation, ACLs, perimeter design, and secure connectivity across Cisco-based environments.

This repo is actively expanding as I move through advanced networking specializations.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This repository shows practical, real-world capability in:

- Routing and switching fundamentals  
- VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing  
- NAT, PAT, DHCP relay  
- ACLs (standard, extended, stateful concepts)  
- Layer-2 and Layer-3 network security  
- Perimeter network design and segmentation  
- Multi-area OSPF deployment + optimization  
- IPSec site-to-site VPN implementation  
- HSRP redundancy and failover design  
- IDS/SPAN monitoring and analysis  
- Enterprise DMZ and firewall architecture (advanced labs)

Each lab includes:

- Topology diagrams  
- Configuration files (`/configs`)  
- Screenshots (`/screenshots`)  
- Verification commands  
- Documentation (`README.md`)

## 🔥 Advanced Networking Track (In Progress)

These labs represent full enterprise network engineering skill:

### **01 – DMZ Firewall Design**
Perimeter firewall, DMZ segmentation, NAT, inbound/outbound ACLs, and server isolation.

### **02 – Enterprise VLAN Segmentation**
Finance, HR, Admin, Servers, Guest, and production segmentation with ACL-based boundaries.

### **03 – OSPF Multi-Area**
Area 0 backbone, area separation, summarization, and stub/totally-stubby configurations.

### **04 – Site-to-Site IPSec VPN**
ISAKMP Phase 1, Phase 2, transform sets, crypto ACLs, and tunnel verification.

### **05 – L3 Core Switching**
SVIs, routed switchports, inter-VLAN routing, server-farm segmentation, ACL policy enforcement.

### **06 – High Availability (HSRP)**
Active/standby default gateway redundancy, preemption, and failover validation.

### **07 – IDS/SPAN Monitoring**
SPAN port mirroring, traffic sniffing, malware pattern detection, and mitigation strategies.

These advanced labs integrate directly with my cybersecurity projects (SOC lab, firewall design, IR).

## 🧪 Verification Commands

Every lab includes validation like:

- `show ip route`  
- `show ip interface brief`  
- `show vlan`  
- `show spanning-tree`  
- `show access-lists`  
- `show ip ospf neighbor`  
- `show crypto isakmp sa`  
- `show standby`  
- Packet captures (Wireshark)  
- Connectivity tests (ping / traceroute)  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Platforms

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- GNS3 / EVE-NG (advanced labs)  
- Wireshark  
- Linux/Windows endpoints (SPAN/IDS labs)  
- Firewall simulation (ASA/PFs conceptual alignment)

## 📈 Status

- **Foundational Labs:** Complete  
- **Intermediate Labs:** Complete  
- **Advanced Labs:** In progress  
- **Integration with cybersecurity portfolio:** Ongoing
