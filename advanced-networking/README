# 📘 Advanced Networking Labs

A collection of advanced, enterprise-grade networking and security labs built with Cisco Packet Tracer and Cisco IOS.  
These labs go far beyond introductory routing and ACL tasks — each project demonstrates the ability to design, secure, and operate complex multi-layer networks.

This section is intended to showcase skills used in professional environments such as:

- Cybersecurity Analyst / SOC roles  
- Canadian Armed Forces Cyber Operator  
- Network Security Engineering  
- Infrastructure / NetOps positions  

These are **not** student-level labs.  
Each design models real-world architectures using multiple routers, switches, VLANs, DMZs, VPN tunnels, and layered security controls.

## 🔥 What These Labs Demonstrate

Each advanced lab is designed to prove hands-on capability in:

- Enterprise network segmentation  
- Perimeter security and DMZ design  
- Layer-3 switching  
- Multi-area OSPF routing  
- IPSec site-to-site VPN tunnels  
- Firewall-style extended ACL logic  
- High availability (HSRP)  
- SPAN/IDS monitoring & packet analysis  
- Multi-router, multi-switch enterprise topologies  

All labs include:

- Topology diagrams  
- Device/module requirements  
- IP addressing plans  
- Step-by-step configurations  
- Verification commands  
- Troubleshooting  
- Packet Tracer `.pkt` files  
- Screenshots & notes

## 📁 Advanced Lab Index

### **01 – DMZ Firewall Design**  
`/advanced-networking/DMZ-Firewall-Design/`  
A complete perimeter architecture using an external router, DMZ zone, internal LAN, NAT, static NAT, and ACL-based firewalling. Includes isolation rules preventing DMZ→LAN lateral movement.

---

### **02 – Enterprise VLAN Segmentation**  
`/advanced-networking/Enterprise-VLAN-Segmentation/`  
Multiple VLANs (Finance, HR, Guest, Admin, Servers) using router-on-a-stick or L3 SVIs, trunk links, inter-VLAN routing, and ACL enforcement between departments.

---

### **03 – OSPF Multi-Area Routing**  
`/advanced-networking/OSPF-MultiArea/`  
Enterprise OSPF with backbone (Area 0), additional areas, stub/totally stubby design, route summarization, and prefix filtering.

---

### **04 – Site-to-Site IPSec VPN Tunnel**  
`/advanced-networking/Site-to-Site-VPN-IPSec/`  
Simulate secure encrypted communication between two remote sites using ISAKMP Phase 1, IPSec Phase 2, transform sets, crypto ACLs, and tunnel verification commands.

---

### **05 – L3 Core Switching & ACL Security**  
`/advanced-networking/L3-Core-Switching/`  
Design a routed enterprise core switch with SVIs, server farm segmentation, access-layer uplinks, and ACL boundary rules.

---

### **06 – High Availability (HSRP)**  
`/advanced-networking/High-Availability-HSRP/`  
Implement redundant default gateways with HSRP (active/standby), priority tuning, preemption, and failover testing.

---

### **07 – IDS / SPAN Monitoring Lab**  
`/advanced-networking/IDS-SPAN-Monitoring/`  
Configure SPAN (port mirroring), attach a sniffer host, capture attack/malicious traffic, analyze packets, and apply mitigation using ACLs.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco IOS CLI  
- Optional: GNS3  
- Wireshark (SPAN labs)  
- Professional network diagrams

## 🎯 Purpose of This Section

This directory exists to demonstrate **enterprise-level networking skills**, not just academic exercises.

It shows you can:

- build real multi-router networks  
- secure boundaries using layered controls  
- design functional DMZ and VLAN architectures  
- configure enterprise routing protocols  
- operate and defend networks at a professional level  

These labs elevate the portfolio from “student projects” to **real-world engineering and cyber operations readiness**.
