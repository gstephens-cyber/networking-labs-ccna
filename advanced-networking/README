# 📘 Advanced Networking Labs

A collection of advanced, enterprise-grade networking and security labs built using Cisco Packet Tracer and Cisco IOS.  
These labs extend beyond basic routing and ACL tasks — each project demonstrates real-world network design skills used in:

- Cybersecurity Analyst / SOC roles  
- Canadian Armed Forces Cyber Operator  
- Network Security Engineering  
- Infrastructure / NetOps  

These are **not** student-level labs.  
Each one reflects multi-device, multi-layer, security-focused architectures with DMZs, VLANs, VPNs, and advanced routing.

## 🔥 What These Labs Demonstrate

Each advanced lab is designed to showcase:

- Enterprise network segmentation  
- Perimeter security & DMZ architecture  
- Layer-3 switching  
- Multi-area OSPF routing  
- IPSec site-to-site VPN tunnels  
- Firewall-style extended ACL logic  
- High availability (HSRP)  
- SPAN/IDS traffic monitoring  
- Multi-router, multi-switch network topologies  

---

### 🧰 Included in Every Lab

- Topology diagrams  
- Required devices/modules  
- IP addressing plans  
- Step-by-step configurations  
- Verification & troubleshooting  
- Packet Tracer `.pkt` files  
- Screenshots and technical notes

---

### **L3 Core Switching & Server Segmentation**  
`/advanced-networking/L3-Core-Switching/`  
Enterprise core switch design using routed SVIs, server farm segmentation, access layer uplinks, and ACL firewalling.

---

### **High Availability (HSRP)**  
`/advanced-networking/High-Availability-HSRP/`  
Redundant gateway design using HSRP active/standby, priority tuning, preemption, and failover testing.

---

### **IDS / SPAN Monitoring Lab**  
`/advanced-networking/IDS-SPAN-Monitoring/`  
Configure SPAN (port mirroring), attach a sniffer host, capture attack traffic with Wireshark, and apply ACL mitigation.

# 🛠 Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco IOS CLI  
- Wireshark (SPAN/IDS labs)  
- Optional: GNS3 for extended simulation

# 🎯 Purpose of This Section

This directory exists to demonstrate **enterprise-level networking competency**, not classroom exercises.

It shows the ability to:

- design multi-router architectures  
- segment and secure networks  
- implement VPN encryption  
- build DMZ and perimeter defenses  
- apply layered security controls  
- operate and troubleshoot production-style networks  

These labs elevate the portfolio to **professional engineering and cyber-operations readiness**.
