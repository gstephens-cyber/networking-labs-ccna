# Advanced Networking

Enterprise-grade Packet Tracer labs focused on real-world routing, switching, segmentation, and network security.  
Each lab includes a dedicated folder, a clean `README.md`, and a `Screenshots/` evidence trail for verification.

---

## ✅ Completed Labs

### DMZ Firewall Design
Design and implementation of a DMZ-style perimeter architecture with clear trust zones and controlled traffic flow.

- **Lab:** [DMZ-Firewall-Design](./DMZ-Firewall-Design/)

---

### Enterprise VLAN Segmentation
Enterprise VLAN design with segmentation, trunking, and verification evidence captured end-to-end.

- **Lab:** [Enterprise-VLAN-Segmentation](./Enterprise-VLAN-Segmentation/)

---

### OSPF Multi-Area Routing
Hierarchical OSPF design using **Area 0 backbone** with multiple non-backbone areas, ABRs, verification of neighbors, inter-area routes, and end-to-end reachability.

- **Lab:** [ospf-multi-area-routing](./ospf-multi-area-routing/)

---

## 🟡 In Progress

### Site-to-Site IPSec VPN
Site-to-site VPN between two networks across an untrusted WAN using IKE Phase 1/2, crypto maps, and encryption verification.

- **Lab:** [site-to-site-ipsec-vpn](./site-to-site-ipsec-vpn/)

---

## 🔜 Planned (Next Up)
These are queued after IPSec VPN to expand enterprise routing + security coverage:

- OSPF Route Summarization & Optimization
- OSPF Route Redistribution (Static / Connected)
- NAT/PAT + ACL enforcement
- HSRP (High Availability)
- Basic BGP Fundamentals (edge routing)

---

## Documentation Standard (Locked)
Each lab folder follows this structure:

- `README.md` (formatted, paste-ready, GitHub-rendered cleanly)
- `Screenshots/` (evidence trail using `01_`, `02_` naming)
- `.pkt` file at the lab root when applicable

---

## Status
Active development — labs are added, verified, and published continuously.
